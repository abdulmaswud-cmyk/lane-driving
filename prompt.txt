## 📱 Cursor Build Prompt: Lane-Switching Car Game (Expo / React Native)

### 1. App Overview

Build a **native mobile car game** using **Expo + React Native** where the player controls a car that **switches lanes to avoid obstacles**.
The game integrates a **public recipe API** in a creative way: recipes act as **power-ups, themes, or score modifiers** that appear during gameplay.

The app should be:

* Mobile-first (iOS & Android)
* Built with Expo
* Clean, responsive, and performant
* Deployable via **Vercel (Expo Web build)**

---

### 2. Technical Requirements

* **Framework:** Expo (React Native)
* **Language:** TypeScript
* **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
* **Game Loop:** requestAnimationFrame or setInterval
* **Navigation:** expo-router or React Navigation
* **API Fetching:** fetch / axios
* **Animations:** Animated API or Reanimated
* **Deployment Target:** Vercel (Expo Web)

---

### 3. Core Game Mechanics

* Vertical scrolling road with **3 lanes**
* Player car can switch lanes via:

  * Swipe left / right
  * Or tap buttons
* Obstacles spawn randomly and move downward
* Collision detection ends the game
* Increasing difficulty over time (speed & spawn rate)

---

### 4. Features

#### Gameplay

* Lane switching
* Score counter (distance survived)
* Increasing difficulty
* Game over & restart screen

#### Recipe API Integration

* Fetch recipes from an **open public recipe API**
* Recipes appear as:

  * Power-ups (speed boost, shield, slow obstacles)
  * Visual collectibles
  * Score multipliers
* Display recipe name + thumbnail when collected

#### UI

* Start screen
* Game screen
* Game over screen
* Optional recipe detail modal

---

### 5. API Specification

Use a **free and open recipe API**, such as:

**TheMealDB (recommended)**

* Base URL: `https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1`
* Example endpoint:
  `/search.php?s=chicken`

**Usage in Game**

* Fetch random recipes on game start
* Store recipe list in state
* Randomly spawn recipe items on the road
* On collection, apply effect based on recipe category or area

---

### 6. Styling & UX

* Use a **dark asphalt road** with white lane dividers
* Bright, arcade-style colors
* Simple car and obstacle shapes (rectangles or SVGs)
* Smooth animations (60 FPS target)
* Mobile-friendly touch controls
* Responsive layout for Expo Web

### 7. File Structure

```
/app
  ├── index.tsx          // Start screen
  ├── game.tsx           // Main game loop
  ├── gameover.tsx       // Game over screen
/components

  ├── Obstacle.tsx
  ├── RecipeItem.tsx
/hooks
  ├── useGameLoop.ts
  ├── useRecipes.ts
/utils
  ├── collision.ts
  ├── constants.ts
```

### 8. Deployment Readiness

* Compatible with **Expo Web**
* No native-only dependencies
* Environment variables supported via `process.env`
* Optimized for Vercel deployment
* Include `npm run build:web` compatibility

---

### 9. Output Expectations

Generate:

1. Fully functional Expo app code
2. Clean, commented React Native components
3. Recipe API integration
4. Lane-switching game logic
5. Ready-to-deploy Expo Web build
6. Instructions to run locally and deploy on Vercel

---

### 10. Development Notes

* Favor simplicity over realism
* Use placeholder graphics where needed
* Ensure all API calls are safe and error-handled
* Code should be production-ready and readable

---

**End of Prompt**

If you want, I can also:

* Convert this into a **Cursor “system prompt”**
* Add **monetization mechanics**
* Replace recipes with **AI-generated content**
* Add **multiplayer or leaderboard support**

Just tell me 👍
